        <h1>Childish Gambino!</h1>
        <h2>Donald Glover</h2>
Donald McKinley Glover was born on Sept. 25, 1983, at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Glover’s family moved to Georgia when he was still very young and was raised principally in the community of Stone Mountain, about 20 miles northeast of Atlanta. According to Glover, Stone Mountain at that time was primarily a white suburb and his family was one of the only African-American families in the area.
Glover's father worked in a post office, and his mother was a day-care manager. Glover has a brother and a sister, and two adopted siblings. His parents, both Jehovah’s Witnesses, took in foster children for many years, and Glover describes a household that was at times chaotic.
In high school, Glover became involved in musicals and plays. After high school, he attended New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts and graduated in 2006 with a degree in dramatic writing. After graduation, he produced comedy videos with former classmates who formed a troupe called Derrick Comedy.
